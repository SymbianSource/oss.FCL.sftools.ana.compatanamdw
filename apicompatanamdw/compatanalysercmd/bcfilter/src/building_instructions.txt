BCFilter building instructions
==============================

Windows platform
----------------

1) Set up MinGW and MSYS compiling environments
   - Download MinGW installer 5.0.2 (or newer) from http://www.mingw.org
   - Install MinGW including GCC compiler with version number at least 3.4.2
   - Download and install MSYS environment from http://www.mingw.org with
     version number at least 1.0.11
   - Set "bin"-directories of both MinGW and MSYS to your path environment, eg
        SET PATH=C:\APPS\MinGW\bin;C:\APPS\MSYS\bin;%PATH%  

2) Download Xerces-C 2.7.0 sources from http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/
   Install it to any folder.

3) Modify "XERCESHOME"-variable in a file "group/MakeFile" in BCFilter
   installation to point to the directory where you installed Xerces-C.

4) Copy libxerces-c2_7_0.dll under lib directory of your Xerces-C installation.
   Alternatively you may have to compile Xerces-C yourself, before it can be
   used. To do that follow these steps:
     1) Extract Xerces-C sources under MSYS installation
     2) Start bash by typing "sh" (ie msys\bin\sh.exe)
     3) Set XERCESCROOT environment variable to the directory where you just
        extracted the sources, for example
            export XERCESCROOT=/home/user-id/src/xerces-c-src_2_7_0
     4) Go to the source directory xerces-c-src_2_7_0/src/xercesc
     5) Type "runConfigure -p mingw-msys -cgcc -xg++ -nfileonly -tnative -rnone"
     6) Type Make
     7) Close bash with "exit" command
     8) Now you have the compiler Xerces-C environment. Copy it or update
        XERCESHOME in the Makefile. Make sure that the *.dll files from
        xerces-c-src_2_7_0/lib are the same as in the BCFilter/bin folder          
   
5) With command prompt, go to the same "group" directory and type "make". 



Any other platform
------------------

Set up GCC compiling environment as usually and follow steps 2-5 just like in the
instructions for Windows platform. Modify variables to suitable to your environment.
