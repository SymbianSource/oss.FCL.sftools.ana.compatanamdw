HeaderAnalyser building instructions
====================================

Windows platform
----------------

1) Set up MinGW and MSYS compiling environments
   - Download MinGW installer 5.1.4 from http://www.mingw.org
   - Install MinGW including GCC compiler with version number at least 3.4.2
   - Download and install MSYS environment from http://www.mingw.org with
     version number at least 1.0.11
   - Set "bin"-directories of both MinGW and MSYS to your path environment, eg
        SET PATH=C:\APPS\MinGW\bin;C:\APPS\MSYS\bin;%PATH%  

2) Download Xerces-C 2.7.0 sources from http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/
   Install it to any folder.

3) Modify "XERCESHOME"-variable in a file "group/MakeFile" in HeaderAnalyser
   installation to point to the directory where you installed Xerces-C.

4) Copy libxerces-c2_7_0.dll under lib directory of your Xerces-C installation
   as libxerces-c.dll. Alternatively you may have to compile Xerces-C yourself,
   before it can be used. To do that follow these steps:
     1) Extract Xerces-C sources under MSYS installation
     2) Start bash by typing "sh" (ie msys\bin\sh.exe)
     3) Set XERCESCROOT environment variable to the directory where you just
        extracted the sources, for example
            export XERCESCROOT=/home/user-id/src/xerces-c-src_2_7_0
     4) Go to the source directory xerces-c-src_2_7_0/src/xercesc
     5) Type "runConfigure -p mingw-msys -cgcc -xg++ -nfileonly -tnative -rnone"
     6) Type Make
     7) Close bash with "exit" command
     8) Now you have the compiler Xerces-C environment. Copy it or update
        XERCESHOME in the Makefile. Make sure that the *.dll files from
        xerces-c-src_2_7_0/lib are the same as in the HeaderAnalyser/bin folder  
        
5) Download Boost v1.33.1 from http://www.boost.org or directly from
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586. Install it to any
   folder
   
6) Download Boost Jam from http://www.boost.org. This is required to build the 
   boost libraries. Copy the exe to the "bin" directory of MinGW.
   
7) Build the Boost libraries for gcc toolset. To do that folloe these steps:
     1) With command prompt, go to the Boost Install directory 
     2) Type the following command
        bjam.exe -sTOOLS=gcc --with-thread --builddir=C:\Boost install
     3) Copy the boost_thread-gcc-mt-1_33_1.lib created under C:\Boost\lib to 
        lib folder under Boost Install directory
   
8) Modify "BOOSTHOME"-variable in a file "group/MakeFile" in HeaderAnalyser
   installation to point to the directory where you installed Boost.

9) With command prompt, go to the same "group" directory and type "make". 



Any other platform
------------------

Set up GCC compiling environment as usually and follow steps 2-9 just like in the
instructions for Windows platform. Modify variables to suit your environment.
