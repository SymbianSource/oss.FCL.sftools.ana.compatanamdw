RELEASE NOTES - COMPATIBILITY ANALYSER v2.8.4
RELEASED 16th February 2010 

===============================================================================

Product Description:
====================

Compatibility Analyser compares a set of files in two different versions of Symbian
releases against predefined Binary Compatibility (BC) criteria, and reports any
changes that affect BC. The analysis is done on header files or import
libraries of the platform. Preserving BC is central in Symbian development to
ensure that any executable that was built against an older version can be run without 
changes on a newer version of the platform .The comparison is made between a
baseline version of an Symbian release (for example, a Public SDK from Forum Nokia)
and a newer, current SDK version that needs to be verified. Compatibility
reports can be filtered so that they compare the found issues against a known
issues file. This file (knownissues.xml) contains information on whether or not
the same BC problems have occurred before in the Symbian Platform and what should
be done about them.

Compatibility Analyser uses three additional utilities for the analysis process,
HeaderAnalyser, LibraryAnalyser and BCFilter. Please see the release notes of
those tools for details.

Main Features:
==============
- By using static analysis for header and import library files, you can find
  binary and source compatibility issues by comparing a baseline and current
  release
- Analysis can be done for a whole release, for a set of files or for a single
  file
- Generated report files can be filtered by using a known issues file

What's New in v2.8.4
====================
CA supports QT headers and libraries analysis on Symbian.

- Change: In HA:- CA:Re-write the HandleExports() logic in HA to support both Symbian and Qt exported logic
- Change: In HA:- QT: Rules implementation
                      1) default arguement value change
                      2) exported function analysis irrespective of its accessibility
                      3)first time over loaded function
- Change: In HA:- Symbian_os.hrh should be included for all round of compilation. Investigated and solved the issue.
- Fix: In HA:- Symian Headers split issue : LineNumber Changes with issue file loc done.
- Change: In LA:- RVCT-4 ToolChain support in Library Analyser.
- Change: In CheckBC:- Implemented the logic to use the common data gloabal_data.xml file created.
- Change: In CheckBC:- 5.2 platformdata file updated with TB9.2 wk02 2010 content along with QT dependency info.
- Change: In CheckBC:- Validation of build target logic changed. Remove the build type option for ure/udeb. Only urel is supported
- Fix: In CheckBC:- Validation of given SDK dir is needed while taking the DLLs from the respective release folder.

Installation Notes:
===================
Compatibility Analyser is part of the BCTools package. It is preinstalled in
all Symbian Platform/OEM releases under [EPOCROOT]\epoc32\tools\s60rndtools\bctools
directory.

===============================================================================

System Requirements:
====================
Basic Requirements:
- Windows 2000 or XP with 256MB RAM
- Python 2.4-2.6

===============================================================================

Compatibility Issues:
=====================
N/A

===============================================================================

Known Issues:
=============
- From TB9.2 onwards, the epoc32\include\mw\QT folder should be excluded using config_template file.
  This is required because this Qt folder conttains all the duplicate header entries present in other folders like mw\Qtcore,mw\Qtgui,mw\QtSql etc.
  The excluded param in config is EXCLUDE_DIR_HEADERS.
  ex:- EXCLUDE_DIR_HEADERS =Qt
- CA won't support Qt header analysis for SDK version < 5.2
- Currently Qt headers are present by dafault in epoc32\include\mw in any TB9.2 sdk.
  Changes in this location path may result in compilation errors for Qt headers. In that case, platform data file needs to be updated.

Version History:
================
Version 2.8.3 - 2nd December 2009
--------------------------------
- Change: In HA:- Multiple threading logic is made configurable. By default it is disabled. 
  "-usethread" is the param. If not mentioned in HA command option, threading logic will be disabled.
- Checkbc.py supports Multiple thread using Config param.
  For Public vs Rnd SDK analysis or for small no of header analysis (<3000), set the "USE_THREAD" in config_template as "true".
  For Rnd vs Rnd sdk analysis or large no. of headers analysis, keep the "USE_THREAD" as "false" or empty.  
- Fix: In HA:- For overloaded functions, the mangled attribute wil also be checked with functiion name present in gccxml output.
- Fix: In HA:- For GCC XML compilation, __GNUC__ macro should be enabled instead of __GCCE__.
